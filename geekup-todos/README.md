## Candidate information

## Approaches

I selected the below libraries for the assessment for some reason:

1. React.js is the core technology in the summer internship at Geek Up
2. Tailwind CSS and Zustand are my preferences in SPA development with React.js
3. I use Vite as project bundler and build tool because of its fast HRM and modern approach in web application development

**Core UI library**: React.js
