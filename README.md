# ReactJS Practice Repository

This repository is a collection of practical projects I've worked on during a ReactJS course.
This repository is mainly used for archiving purposes and personal reference. Feel free to browse the projects and use them as a reference for your own projects.

## What ReactJS course did I take?
[React Tutorial and Projects Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/?referralCode=FEE6A921AF07E2563CEF) by [John Smilga](https://johnsmilga.com/).

My thoughts on the course:
- The course is very beginner friendly. It's a great course for people who are new to ReactJS.
- John's English is very clear and easy to understand.
- To be honest that I didn't fully do whatever John did in the course. I found some practical and powerful for replacements of his implementations.
- I like the idea that you have the oppurtunity to build your own projects after each section. It's a great way to practice and apply what you've learned. And there's a lot of projects to choose from.
